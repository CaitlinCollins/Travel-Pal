## User Story

I am a frequent international traveller and I want an application that allows me to input a city name and provide me with all the necessary information to make my travels easier. 

The application will provide me with the following:

I will receive the 5-day forecast of my specified location, including: date, high and low temperature, humidity, and weather icon.

I will be alerted to the local currency and be given the US dollar exchange rate.

When I enter a phrase in English, I can select the appropriate language and the application will return the correct translation. 

When I close my application, my most recent query will be stored and will remain on the page when I open it again. 

The application will be responsive to whatever device I am using at the moment.
